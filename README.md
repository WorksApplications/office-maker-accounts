## Provided Functions
### For Logged In Administrator
- add unique name tenant
- delete, get tenant belongs to him

- add, update, get, delete saml Provider for his tenant
- set (add, update) jwt expire length
- set (add, update) login expire length: the time a user must finish saml login within
- set (add, update) redirect url: default redirect url, could be override with query parameter `state=` passed when initial the login 

- jwt expire time, login expire time, and redirect url cannot be delete directly (delete when tenant is deleted)

- choose to enable [login free](#login-free) function or not
- choose to enable [login restrict](#login-restrict) function or not
- (todo) enable super restrict mode, only able to access within given IP, mobile network will not be able to use
 
- (todo) add, update, delete worksmap manager for the tenant
- (todo) connect to the tenant's database to get employees detail information, and provide a mapping

### Login Free
Login free is a function allows tenant user to READ the map without login as long as the user's IP address is contained in an IP list the administrator set

While setting, if Login Free is enabled, the corresponding ip string must be provided. This string is comma separated ip, e.g. (1.1.1.1,3.3.3.3)

### Login Restrict
Login Restrict is a function that only allow tenant user to login himself when his IP address is contained in an IP list the administrator set

There is an extra option `bufferTime` that additional allow user to login even if his IP address is not in given IP as long as he has logged in within `bufferTime`.

Notice, for login restrict function, if a user is logged in, he could access worksmap in maximum time: bufferTime + jwtExpiredTime

e.g.:

If you want user to be unable to access to worksmap as long as he is delete from organization unit, you should use a small jwtExpiredTime like 60 seconds.

But you also want to allow user to be able to use worksmap with IP restriction, along with as long as his was logged in in 15 minutes, then the bufferTime should be set to 840 seconds.

Or simply set jwtExpiredTime to 5 minutes (300 seconds) and bufferTime to 0.
